# The meaning of every line is the following:
#  RewriteEngine on: Enable the runtime rewriting engine.
#  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f: The rewriting will take place if the 
#      requested filename is not a regular file or if the file doesn't exist.
#  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d: The rewriting will take place if the 
#      requested filename is not directory or if the directory doesn't exist.
#  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ / [L,QSA]: If the above conditions both match (the 
#      requested file isn't a file, isn't a directory, and doesn't exist) then 
#      the URL will be rewritten to the root of your website. The "L" means  
#      that the rewriting process should stop immediately after this rule has 
#      been applied and the "QSA" means that any query string from the  
#      original request URL must be appended to the rewrite target.
